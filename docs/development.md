### 4.4 Error Handling & Resilience
- [ ] Robust offline mode handling
- [ ] Network failure recovery
- [ ] API quota management
- [ ] User-friendly error messages

## Phase 5: Beta & Refinement (Weeks 12-14)

### 5.1 Beta Release Preparation
- [ ] Create installer packages for all platforms

- [ ] Add comprehensive logging and crash reporting
- [ ] Create onboarding flow and tutorials

### 5.2 User Testing & Feedback
- [ ] Deploy to limited beta group (50-100 users)
- [ ] Collect usage analytics and feedback
- [ ] A/B test pricing tiers and features
- [ ] Iterate based on real usage patterns

### 5.3 Business Integration
- [ ] Implement subscription system
- [ ] Add usage tracking and billing
- [ ] Create user dashboard/account management
- [ ] Set up payment processing

## Phase 6: Launch & Scale (Weeks 15-16)

### 6.1 Production Launch
- [ ] Final security audit and testing
- [ ] Marketing website and documentation
- [ ] App store submissions (if applicable)
- [ ] Launch announcement and outreach

### 6.2 Post-Launch Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor performance and error rates
- [ ] Track user engagement and retention
- [ ] Gather feature requests and prioritize roadmap
- [ ] Plan next major version features
